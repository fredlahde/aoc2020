# Advent of Code 2020

These are the results of me trying to solve the AoC 2020 puzzles as fast as I can.
Solutions are pushed immediately after solving, no cleanup. The full, raw, mess :D

Sometimes I'll revisit the problem and refactor it or implement alternative solutions.
These will be written in different files than the original soution and named accordingly.
